= Securing microservices with JSON Web Tokens

You'll explore how to control user and role access to microservices with MicroProfile JSON Web Token (MicroProfile JWT).

// =================================================================================================
//  What you'll learn
// =================================================================================================

== What you'll learn

You will add MicroProfile JWT to validate security tokens in the `system` and `inventory` microservices. You will use a token-based authentication mechanism to authenticate, authorize, and verify user identities based on a security token.

In addition, you will learn how to verify token claims through getters with MicroProfile JWT.

For microservices, a token-based authentication mechanism offers a lightweight way for security controls and security tokens to propagate user identities across different services. JSON Web Token (JWT) is becoming the most common token format because it follows well-defined and known standards.

MicroProfile JWT standards define the required format of JWT for authentication and authorization. The standards also map JWT token claims to various Java EE container APIs and make the set of claims available through getters.

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory contains the finished
JWT security implementation for the services in the application. You can try the finished application before you build your own.

To try out the application, first navigate to the `finish` directory. Next, execute the following
Maven goals to build the application and run it inside of Open Liberty:

```
mvn clean install liberty:start-server
```

Navigate your browser to the front-end web application endpoint: `http://localhost:9090/application.jsf`. From here, you can log in to the application with the form-based login.
Log in with one of the following user information credentials:

|===
| *Username* | *Password* | *Role*
| bob | bobpwd | admin, user
| alice | alicepwd | user
| carl | carlpwd | user
|===

You are redirected to a page that displays the user who is logged in, the current OS of your localhost, and the security token that the front end uses when it sends the HTTP request to access the data from the back end.
In addition, if you log in as an `admin` user, the current inventory size appears. If you log in as a `user`, you instead see the message, `You are not authorized to access the inventory service.`, which means you cannot access the inventory service in the back end.

When you are done with the application, stop the server with the following command:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

Now, navigate back to the `start` directory to begin.

// Securing back-end services with MicroProfile JWT
// =================================================================================================

== Securing back-end services with MicroProfile JWT

The MicroProfile JWT feature, `microprofile-jwt-auth-api`, is added as a dependency in your `start/backendServices/pom.xml` file.

// =================================================================================================
// Creating the server configuration file
// =================================================================================================

=== Creating the server configuration file

In the `start/backendServices/src/main/liberty/config` directory, create a configuration file named `server.xml`.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/backendServices/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[tags=jwt]
----

The `<feature>mpJwt-1.0</feature>` feature adds the libraries that are required for MicroProfile JWT implementation.

The `<mpJwt>` element is required to configure the injection of the caller's JWT.

|===
| `issuer` | Issues security tokens and must match the `iss` claim in the JWT.
| `audiences` | Identifies the recipients and must match the `aud` claim in the JWT.
| `keyName` | Specifies the key alias name to locate public key for JWT signature validation and must be in the truststore in the SSL configuration.
|===

// =================================================================================================
// Securing the system service
// =================================================================================================

=== Securing the system service

Open the `start/backendServices/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemResource.java` file and modify it to match the following code:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/backendServices/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemResource.java[tags=jwt;!copyright]
----

Role names that are used in the `@RolesAllowed` annotation are mapped to group names in the `groups` claim of the JWT, which results in an authorization decision wherever the security constraint is applied.

The `@RolesAllowed({"admin", "user"})` annotation allows only authenticated users with `admin` and `user` roles to access the `system` service.
Therefore, this service is properly secured.

// =================================================================================================
// Securing the inventory service
// =================================================================================================

=== Securing the inventory service

In the `start/backendServices/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/` directory, open the `InventoryResource.java` file  and add roles-based access control as shown in the following command:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/backendServices/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java[tags=jwt;!copyright]
----

Similarly, for each specific service, the `@RolesAllowed` annotation sets which roles are allowed to access it. Therefore, the inventory service is properly secured, as well.

In addition, the `getPropertiesForHost()` method gets the HTTP Authorization header, which contains the corresponding security token, from the HTTP request caller. The method uses this authorization header to retrieve information from the `system` service.

The final addition of the `manager.get(hostname, authHeader)` code adds the authentication header to the client that sends the HTTP GET request to the `system` service.

// =================================================================================================
// Adding the SecureSystemClient class
// =================================================================================================

=== Adding the SecureSystemClient class

In the beginning, the inventory service uses the normal `SystemClient` class to create a client and send HTTP GET requests to retrieve information from the system service.
However, after you secure the system service with token-based authentication, you need to add security tokens when you send HTTP requests through the client.

Add the `SecureSystemClient` class in the `start/backendServices/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/client/SecureSystemClient.java` file.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/backendServices/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/client/SecureSystemClient.java[tags=jwt;!copyright]
----

The `SecureSystemClient` class inherits methods from the `SystemClient` class. These methods hand the HTTP GET request to the system service to retrieve system properties.
However, the `SystemClient` class overrides the `buildClientBuilder()` method by adding the authorization header to the returned builder, `return builder.header(HttpHeaders.AUTHORIZATION, authHeader)`.
By adding the authorization header to the client request, the `SecureSystemClient` class can access services that are secured.

// Trying more JAX-RS methods to validate tokens
// =================================================================================================

=== Trying more JAX-RS methods to validate tokens

To demonstrate how MicroProfile JWT retrieves confidential information and validates custom claims from the security token, add an additional service that uses JAX-RS security-related methods. The JWT service also illustrates how JAX-RS methods map to MicroProfile JWT features.

Create a `start/backendServices/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/JwtResource.java` file to enable a service that retrieves information from the token.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/backendServices/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/JwtResource.java[tags=jwt;!copyright]
----

MicroProfile JWT maps its token claims to JAX-RS security-related methods and makes the set of claims available through getters.

The `getJwtUsername()` feature retrieves the user name from the injected `JsonWebToken jwtPrincipal` principal by calling the `getName()` claim.

The `getGroups()` feature retrieves the user groups information from the JWT from the SecurityContext.
The `SecurityContext.getUserPrincipal()` feature returns an object in the `java.security.Principal` type. This object is also an instance of the `org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken` type.

The `getCustomClaim()` claim retrieves the custom claim from the token if the authenticated user has the `admin` role. Otherwise, it returns a `Status.FORBIDDEN` message.
The `SecurityContext.isUserInRole(String)` feature returns a `true` value for any role that appears in the MicroProfile JWT `groups` claim because role names are mapped to group names in the claim.
The `jwtPrincipal.getClaim("customClaim")` feature retrieves the value of the custom claim by its name. This feature is useful when you want to validate information about a custom claim from the security token.

include::{common-includes}/mvnbuild.adoc[]

After the Open Liberty application server starts, you can log in to the system with the simple front end. The entire front end code is provided for you to test if you can retrieve information from the back end services by using a valid security token.

You cannot directly visit a back end URL from a browser because no valid tokens exist in the authorization header when you send HTTP requests through a browser. You have to use the provided front end to create a web client to send HTTP GET requests with valid security tokens.

Use one of the following credentials to log in:

|===
| *Username* | *Password* | *Role*
| bob | bobpwd | admin, user
| alice | alicepwd | user
| carl | carlpwd | user
|===

Use the following endpoint to log in to the application:

* `http://localhost:9090/application.jsf`

Once you log in, you can see some basic information about your current session, including the name of the user who is logged in, the role of the user, your current operating system, the size of your inventory service, and the JWT that is used for authorization.
Remember that if you log in as a user without the `admin` role, you cannot see the inventory size because you do not have permission.

include::{common-includes}/mvnpackage.adoc[]

// =================================================================================================
// Testing the application
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the application

Write `SystemEndpointTest`, `InventoryEndpointTest`, and `JwtTest` classes to test that you can access different services with valid tokens.

To begin, create a `start/backendServices/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/jwt/SystemEndpointTest.java` file:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/backendServices/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/jwt/SystemEndpointTest.java[tags=test]
----

Next, create a `start/backendServices/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/jwt/InventoryEndpointTest.java` file:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/backendServices/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/jwt/InventoryEndpointTest.java[tags=test]
----

In the `setup()` step before test cases, an authorization header is created with the credentials of a test user who has the `TESTUSER` name and the `admin` role.
This authorization header is added when the test client sends a GET request to a secure service to retrieve information.

Each test case tries to first assert that with a valid authorization header, it can get a `Status.OK` code from the response.
The test fails if the response returns a `Status.FORBIDDEN` message, which means the authorization header is invalid.

After each test confirms that the response code is correct, each test gets the content from the designated endpoint and compares the result with its expected value.

Create a `start/backendServices/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/jwt/JwtTest.java` file:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/backendServices/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/jwt/JwtTest.java[tags=test]
----

In the `setup()` step of the `JwtTest` test, an authorization header is created with the credentials of a test user who has the `TESTUSER` name and the `user` role.
The authorization header is added when the test client sends a GET request to a secure JWT service.

* The `testJWTGetName()` test accesses the `https://localhost:5051/inventory/jwt/username` endpoint to get the username from the JWT token and to verify
whether the user name is the same as the `TESTUSER` user name.

* The `testJWTGetCustomClaim()` test accesses the `https://localhost:5051/inventory/jwt/customClaim` endpoint. Because this service is secured and only accessible to users who have the `admin` role,
the test asserts that the current test user with the `user` role is forbidden from accessing it.
